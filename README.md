# Triviagame

- This is a How I Met Your Mother trivia game I created.
- This game was a way for me to learn more about timing features in javascript.
- Just click the start button and answer the questions.
- The game will automatically go to the next slide once you have answered the question.
- When you are finished it will tell you how many questions you got right and how many you got wrong.
- You have 20 seconds to complete each multiple choice question.
- Good Luck!
